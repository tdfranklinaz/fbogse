A custom theme called jak-theme, based on a custom base them y OpenForm, based on a start them called underscores.

== Description ==

Hi. I'm a custom theme based originally on a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`. I'm heavily modified and expanded on to provide additional opinionated base theme features specific to OpenForm.

The purpose is to provide a custom theme for Eagle Lake Camps, a property of The Navigators.

I rely on a custom plugin created as a companion to this theme which creates many custom post types. I also rely on a few other plugins, such as: Advanced Custom Fields Pro, Gravity Forms, and maybe more. You'll have to look around to know for sure.
